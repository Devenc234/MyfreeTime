Learn how to use the multi-class support vector machine provided within MATLAB. This is the competing industry strength classifier that y'all will be executing. Write up a description of how this library was executed by your team on the Wine and Iris datasets (and the two other datasets you used). Demonstrate the execution of the SVM classifier on the datasets by first training the classifier on a suitably chosen training set and then testing the classifier on a separate test set (where you know the class labels for each pattern but the machine does not). Document the mis-classification errors (and separate out each class errors as well) for both the SVM and the least-squares classifiers. Document the settings of the free parameters in both the SVM and the least-squares classifiers for each dataset. Give a high level summary of your findings based on your interpretation of the results.

For each dataset, the team should first separate out training and testing patterns. The ratios attempted for training and testing should range from 10% training/90% testing to 50% training/50% testing. For the sake of cross validation, training sets can be further subdivided into training and validation sets as explained in the class notes.
